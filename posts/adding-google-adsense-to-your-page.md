You will not be able to use the same Google ID to create an account, which is already in processing or which has been rejected.
AdSense offers cost-per-click ads (CPC) which means that you earn money every time a user clicks on the ad on your website. and this amount can vary based on multiple factors.

- There is no rule as to where exactly to place the Ad. Place wherever you are comfortable with in your site. In WordPress blogs, you can use Widgets to place the Ads section in whichever place you wish very easily.
- Google is very smart. It has very complicated algorithms to identify who has, and how is he related to you. That means, you clicking on these ads randomly or your friends clicking it often, might get you (your account) banned from the website.
- RPM (Revenue per Mille) or revenue per 1000 impressions is determined by multiplying the total number of clicks and cost per click and then dividing that by the total number of page views.
