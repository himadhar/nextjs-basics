# The Diderot Effect

## Introduction

Recently, I came across this effect called the ‚ÄúDiderot effect‚Äù. I was personally very familiar with this uncontrollable urge to make things in sync. I realised that it all started with the first couple of things I began with. Soon enough, I googled and found out about it!

The Diderot effect is a phenomenon named after the French philosopher Denis Diderot and was coined in 1988 by Grant David McCracken. It refers to people‚Äôs tendency to want more possessions after acquiring a new, desirable item. As part of his essay ‚ÄúRegrets on Parting with My Old Dressing Gown‚Äù, he writes about how he came across a new dressing gown as a gift and all the things that happened after that.

Once he received the gift of this beautiful scarlet dressing gown, his perception of things around him changed. The chair he sat on didn‚Äôt match his dress, so bought a new one. The writing table didn‚Äôt match the new chair that he bought, so he bought a new table. This went on and on spiralling into a whole new spending spree. He became a slave of his possessions! This is the phenomenon.

The idea can further be simplified as ‚Äì the desire for additional possessions can lead to a spiral of consumption, as acquiring new items often creates a need for even more items to go along with them. For example, if you buy a new, expensive piece of furniture, you might then feel the need to buy new decorative items or even paint your walls to match the furniture. This desire for more possessions can be challenging to break, and can ultimately lead to feelings of dissatisfaction and even debt. It‚Äôs important to be mindful of this effect and avoid falling into a cycle of excessive consumption.

## Below Are Some Key Points

- The Diderot Effect can lead to a never-ending cycle of consumption as we constantly strive to improve our possessions.
- The effect often occurs when we receive a significant new possession, such as a new smartphone or a piece of furniture.
- It can result in financial stress and a cluttered living space due to unnecessary purchases.
- Understanding the Diderot Effect can help us make more mindful purchasing decisions and avoid falling into the trap of constant consumerism.

## Example

One example of the Diderot Effect is buying a new piece of furniture for your living room. Once you introduce this new item, you may start feeling dissatisfied with the rest of your furniture, which suddenly appears outdated or mismatched. As a result, you might feel compelled to buy new chairs, a coffee table, and curtains to create a cohesive look. This domino effect can continue indefinitely, leading to a constant cycle of buying and upgrading.

## Conclusion

Being aware of the Diderot Effect can help us break free from the cycle of consumerism. By recognizing that acquiring a new possession doesn't automatically bring happiness or fulfillment, we can make more conscious decisions about our purchases. It's essential to focus on value, quality, and long-term satisfaction rather than succumbing to the desire for instant gratification.
